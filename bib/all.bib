@article{antikt,
abstract = {The k t and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ''anti-k t'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ''iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-k t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.},

abstract = {Electron and photon triggers covering transverse energies from 5 $$\text {GeV }$$ to several $$\text {TeV }$$ are essential for the ATLAS experiment to record signals for a wide variety of physics: from Standard Model processes to searches for new phenomena in both proton–proton and heavy-ion collisions. To cope with a fourfold increase of peak LHC luminosity from 2015 to 2018 (Run 2), to $$2.1 \times 10^{34}\,\hbox {cm}^{-2}\hbox { s}^{-1}$$, and a similar increase in the number of interactions per beam-crossing to about 60, trigger algorithms and selections were optimised to control the rates while retaining a high efficiency for physics analyses. For proton–proton collisions, the single-electron trigger efficiency relative to a single-electron offline selection is at least 75% for an offline electron of 31 $$\text {GeV }$$, and rises to 96% at 60 $$\text {GeV }$$; the trigger efficiency of a 25 $$\text {GeV }$$ leg of the primary diphoton trigger relative to a tight offline photon selection is more than 96% for an offline photon of 30 $$\text {GeV }$$. For heavy-ion collisions, the primary electron and photon trigger efficiencies relative to the corresponding standard offline selections are at least 84% and 95%, respectively, at 5 $$\text {GeV }$$ above the corresponding trigger threshold.},

Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before. After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter.},

It has provided a large amount of data for the precision study of the standard model, first on the Z0 resonance, and then above the W± pair threshold. Finally, with beam energies above 100 GeV, a tantalizing glimpse of what might have been the Higgs boson was observed.

Normalized differential cross sections as a function of the Z/$\gamma$* boson transverse momentum are measured for transverse momenta up to 800 GeV. The measurement is performed inclusively for Z/$\gamma$* rapidities up to 2.4, as well as in three rapidity bins. The channel results are combined, compared to perturbative and resummed QCD calculations and used to constrain the parton shower parameters of Monte Carlo generators.},

abstract = {Jet energy scale and resolution measurements with their associated uncertainties are reported for jets using 36–81 fb $$^{-1}$$ of proton–proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of $$\sqrt{s}=13$$ $${\text {Te}}{\text {V}}$$ collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed using two different input types: topo-clusters formed from energy deposits in calorimeter cells, as well as an algorithmic combination of charged-particle tracks with those topo-clusters, referred to as the ATLAS particle-flow reconstruction method. The anti- $$k_t$$ jet algorithm with radius parameter $$R=0.4$$ is the primary jet definition used for both jet types. This result presents new jet energy scale and resolution measurements in the high pile-up conditions of late LHC Run 2 as well as a full calibration of particle-flow jets in ATLAS. Jets are initially calibrated using a sequence of simulation-based corrections. Next, several in situ techniques are employed to correct for differences between data and simulation and to measure the resolution of jets. The systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scale for central jets ( $$|\eta |<1.2$$ ) vary from 1% for a wide range of high- $$p_{{\text {T}}}$$ jets ( $$2502.5$\sim${\text {Te}}{\text {V}}$$ ). The relative jet energy resolution is measured and ranges from ( $$24 \pm 1.5$$ )% at 20 $${\text {Ge}}{\text {V}}$$ to ( $$6 \pm 0.5$$ )% at 300 $${\text {Ge}}{\text {V}}$$ .},

It is primarily evaluated using events containing a pair of muons from the decay of Z bosons to cover the intermediate momentum range between 26 GeV and 100 GeV. Overall, the efficiency of the single-muon triggers is about 68% in the barrel region and 85% in the endcap region. The pT range for efficiency determination is extended by using muons from decays of J$\psi$ mesons, W bosons, and top quarks. The performance in HI collision data is measured and shows good agreement with the results obtained in pp collisions. The muon trigger shows uniform and stable performance in good agreement with the prediction of a detailed simulation. Dedicated multi-muon triggers with kinematic selections provide the backbone to beauty, quarkonia, and low-mass physics studies. The design, evolution and performance of these triggers are discussed in detail.},

The increased energy of the proton beams and the higher luminosity required a redesign of LUCID to cope with the more demanding conditions. The novelty of the LUCID-2 detector is that it uses the thin quartz windows of photomultipliers as Cherenkov medium and a small amounts of radioactive 207Bi sources deposited on to these windows to monitor the gain stability of the photomultipliers. The result is a fast and accurate luminosity determination that can be kept stable during many months of data taking. LUCID-2 can also measure the luminosity accurately online for each of the up to 2808 colliding bunch pairs in the LHC . These bunch pairs are separated by only 25 ns and new electronics has been built that can count not only the number of pulses above threshold but also integrate the pulses.},

The increased instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC over this period required a reoptimisation of the criteria for the identification of prompt muons. Improved and newly developed algorithms were deployed to preserve high muon identification efficiency with a low misidentification rate and good momentum resolution. The availability of large samples of $Z\rightarrow \mu \mu $ and $J/\psi \rightarrow \mu \mu $ decays, and the minimisation of systematic uncertainties, allows the efficiencies of criteria for muon identification, primary vertex association, and isolation to be measured with an accuracy at the per-mille level in the bulk of the phase space, and up to the percent level in complex kinematic configurations. Excellent performance is achieved over a range of transverse momenta from 3 GeV to several hundred GeV, and across the full muon detector acceptance of $|\eta |<2.7$ .},

abstract = {The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals. The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a well-performing calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.},

abstract = {This document summarizes the method to identify isolated photons in the ATLAS experiment , and the techniques to measure the photon identification efficiencies. The strategy developed during LHC Run-I is repeated on the proton-proton collisions collected during 2015 at √ s = 13 TeV, with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb −1. Three independent analyses have been exploited. One uses photons from radiative Z → $\gamma$ decays. The second extracts the shower shape properties of electrons from Z → ee decays and extrapolates them to photons. The third directly measures the efficiency on samples of reconstructed photons, after determining and subtracting the hadronic background with a technique based on track isolation. The results from all analyses are then compared with each other and with the prediction from the simulation.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals. The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a well-performing calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.},

abstract = {The relativity quantum theory of an electron moving in a given electro­magnetic field, although successful in predicting the spin properties of the electron, yet involves one serious difficulty which shows that some fundamental alteration is necessary before we can regard it as an accurate description of nature. This difficulty is connected with the fact that the wave equation, which is of the form [W/ c + e / c A 0 + $\rho$ 1 ($\sigma$, p + e / c A) + $\rho$ 3 mc ] $\Psi$ = 0, (1) has, in addition to the wanted solutions for which the kinetic energy of the electron is positive, an equal number of unwanted solutions with negative kinetic energy for the electron, which appear to have no physical meaning. Thus if we take the case of a steady electromagnetic field, equation (1) will admit of periodic solutions of the form $\Psi$ = u e - i E t / h , (2) where u is independent of t , representing stationary states, E being the total energy of the state, including the relativity term mc 2 . There will then exist solutions (2) with negative values for E as well as those with positive values ; in fact, if we take a matrix representation of the operators $\rho$ 1 $\sigma$ 1 , $\rho$ 1 $\sigma$ 2 , $\rho$ 1 $\sigma$ 3 , $\rho$ 3 with the matrix elements all real, then the conjugate complex of any solution of (1) will be a solution of the wave equation obtained from (1) by reversal of the sign of the potentials A, and either the original wave function or its con­jugate complex must refer to a negative E.},

The parton-shower approach is used to simulate initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence effects, with special emphasis on the correct description of radiation from heavy particles. The underlying event is simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The formation of hadrons from the quarks and gluons produced in the parton shower is described using the cluster hadronization model.

Several methods are used to measure with data the efficiency of the photon identification requirements, covering a broad energy spectrum. At low energy, photons from radiative Z decays are used. In the medium energy range, similarities between electrons and photon showers are exploited using Z ? ee decays. At high energy, inclusive photon samples are used. The results of these measurements performed with pp collisions data at vs = 13 TeV in 2015-2018 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb-1 are presented.

abstract = {We present the first determination of parton distributions of the nucleon at NLO and NNLO based on a global data set which includes LHC data: NNPDF2.3. Our data set includes, besides the deep inelastic, Drell-Yan, gauge boson production and jet data already used in previous global PDF determinations, all the relevant LHC data for which experimental systematic uncertainties are currently available: ATLAS and LHCb W and Z rapidity distributions from the 2010 run, CMS W electron asymmetry data from the 2011 run, and ATLAS inclusive jet cross-sections from the 2010 run. We introduce an improved implementation of the FastKernel method which allows us to fit to this extended data set, and also to adopt a more effective minimization methodology. We present the NNPDF2.3 PDF sets, and compare them to the NNPDF2.1 sets to assess the impact of the LHC data. We find that all the LHC data are broadly consistent with each other and with all the older data sets included in the fit. We present predictions for various standard candle cross-sections, and compare them to those obtained previously using NNPDF2.1, and specifically discuss the impact of ATLAS electroweak data on the determination of the strangeness fraction of the proton. We also present collider PDF sets, constructed using only data from HERA, the Tevatron and the LHC, but find that this data set is neither precise nor complete enough for a competitive PDF determination. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{EGamCalibration2019,
abstract = {This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration obtained with the ATLAS detector using about 36 fb-1 of LHC proton-proton collision data recorded at s=13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. The different calibration steps applied to the data and the optimization of the reconstruction of electron and photon energies are discussed. The absolute energy scale is set using a large sample of Z boson decays into electron-positron pairs. The systematic uncertainty in the energy scale calibration varies between 0.03% to 0.2% in most of the detector acceptance for electrons with transverse momentum close to 45 GeV . For electrons with transverse momentum of 10 GeV the typical uncertainty is 0.3% to 0.8% and it varies between 0.25% and 1% for photons with transverse momentum around 60 GeV . Validations of the energy calibration with J/$\psi$ → e+e- decays and radiative Z boson decays are also presented.},

@inproceedings{JetFlavourUncerts2011,
abstract = {The energy response of the ATLAS calorimeter to a jet depends on the observable properties of a jet, including, for example, the momentum spectra and number of charged hadrons. The fragmentation differences between jets initiated by a quark and jets initiated by a gluon lead to a flavor dependence in the jet energy scale. Because the flavor content of samples varies, this difference results in an additional flavor-dependent term in the jet energy scale uncertainty. This uncertainty term is derived for a general sample of jets and can be up to ∼6% in cases where the flavor composition of a sample of events is poorly known. A template-fit method for determining the flavor composition of a sample of jets is presented. The templates, based on jet properties sensitive to the partonic origin of the jet, allow the determination of flavor composition with a precision of about 10%. The flavor-dependent term of the jet energy scale systematic uncertainty is correspondingly reduced.},

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and performance of a particle flow algorithm applied to 20.2 fb$$^{-1}$$of ATLAS data from 8 TeV proton–proton collisions in Run 1 of the LHC. The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in resolution and pile-up stability.},

@article{Higgs2013,
abstract = {A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb−1 at $ \sqrt{s}=7 $ TeV, and up to 5.3 fb−1 at $ \sqrt{s}=8 $ TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes $\gamma$$\gamma$, ZZ, WW, $\tau$$\tau$, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, $\gamma$$\gamma$ and ZZ → 4ℓ, gives a mass estimate of 125.3 ± 0.4 (stat.) ± 0.5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons. The measured values of the corresponding couplings are compared to the standard model predictions. The hypothesis of custodial symmetry is tested through the measurement of the ratio of the couplings to the W and Z bosons. All the results are consistent, within their uncertainties, with the expectations for a standard model Higgs boson.},

abstract = {We present NNPDF3.0, the first set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W +c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.},

abstract = {The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider reads out particle collision data from over 100 million electronic channels at a rate of approximately 100 kHz, with a recording rate for physics events of approximately 1 kHz. Before being certified for physics analysis at computer centres worldwide, the data must be scrutinised to ensure they are clean from any hardware or software related issues that may compromise their integrity. Prompt identification of these issues permits fast action to investigate, correct and potentially prevent future such problems that could render the data unusable. This is achieved through the monitoring of detector-level quantities and reconstructed collision event characteristics at key stages of the data processing chain. This paper presents the monitoring and assessment procedures in place at ATLAS during 2015-2018 data-taking. Through the continuous improvement of operational procedures, ATLAS achieved a high data quality efficiency, with 95.6% of the recorded proton-proton collision data collected at s=13 TeV certified for physics analysis.},

@article{TMVA,
abstract = {In high-energy physics, with the search for ever smaller signals in ever larger data sets, it has become essential to extract a maximum of the available information from the data. Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also the multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent years. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to further gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA is a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification algorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all available classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly interfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression of a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user interfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling allowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting method is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework.},

@article{ATLAStrigops2020,
abstract = {The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider employs a two-level trigger system to record data at an average rate of 1 kHz from physics collisions, starting from an initial bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz. During the LHC Run 2 (2015–2018), the ATLAS trigger system operated successfully with excellent performance and flexibility by adapting to the various run conditions encountered and has been vital for the ATLAS Run-2 physics programme. For proton-proton running, approximately 1500 individual event selections were included in a trigger menu which specified the physics signatures and selection algorithms used for the data-taking, and the allocated event rate and bandwidth. The trigger menu must reflect the physics goals for a given data collection period, taking into account the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC and limitations from the ATLAS detector readout, online processing farm, and offline storage. This document discusses the operation of the ATLAS trigger system during the nominal proton-proton data collection in Run 2 with examples of special data-taking runs. Aspects of software validation, evolution of the trigger selection algorithms during Run 2, monitoring of the trigger system and data quality as well as trigger configuration are presented.},

The possibility is explored of having invariance under local isotopic spin rotations. This leads to formulating a principle of isotopic gauge invariance and the existence of a b field which has the same relation to the isotopic spin that the electromagnetic field has to the electric charge. The b field satisfies nonlinear differential equations. The quanta of the b field are particles with spin unity, isotopic spin unity, and electric charge e or zero. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

We then propose a new prescription for the combination of a suitable subset of the available PDF sets, which is presented in terms of a single combined PDF set. We finally discuss tools which allow for the delivery of this combined set in terms of optimized sets of Hessian eigenvectors or Monte Carlo replicas, and their usage, and provide some examples of their application to LHC phenomenology.

Following the first two-year long shutdown and the re-commissioning in 2015 at 6.5 TeV, the beam performance was increased to reach a peak luminosity of more than twice the design value and a colliding beam time ratio of 50%. This was accomplished thanks to the increased beam brightness from the injector chain, the high machine availability and the performance enhancements made in the LHC for which some methods and tools, foreseen for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) were tested and deployed operationally. This contribution provides an overview of the operational aspects, main limitations and achievements for the proton Run 2.},

The search is performed in five decay modes: $\gamma$$\gamma$, ZZ, W+W-, $\tau$+$\tau$-, and bb-. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, $\gamma$$\gamma$ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV.

abstract = {The toolkit for multivariate analysis, TMVA, provides a large set of advanced multivariate analysis techniques for signal/background classification. In addition, TMVA now also contains regression analysis, all embedded in a framework capable of handling the preprocessing of the data and the evaluation of the output, thus allowing a simple and convenient use of multivariate techniques. The analysis techniques implemented in TMVA can be invoked easily and the direct comparison of their performance allows the user to choose the most appropriate for a particular data analysis. This article gives an overview of the TMVA package and presents recently developed features. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Precision measurements of electron reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies and photon identification efficiencies are presented. They use the full Run 2 data of $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS experiment during the years 2015-2018. The measured electron identification efficiencies have uncertainties that are around 30%-50% smaller than the previous Run 2 results due to an improved methodology and the inclusion of more data. A better pile-up subtraction method leads to electron isolation efficiencies that are more independent of the amount of pile-up activity. Updated photon identification efficiencies are also presented, using the full Run 2 data. When compared to the previous measurement, a 30%-40% smaller uncertainty is observed on the photon identification efficiencies, thanks to the increased amount of available data.},

@article{pythia8dot1,
abstract = {The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state. It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, Pythia 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies. Program summary: Program title: Pythia 8.1. Catalogue identifier: ACTU_v3_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ACTU_v3_0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: GPL version 2. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 176 981. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2 411 876. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: C++. Computer: Commodity PCs. Operating system: Linux; should also work on other systems. RAM: 8 megabytes. Classification: 11.2. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes, partly. Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models, transition from Fortran to C++. Summary of revisions: New user interface, transverse-momentum-ordered showers, interleaving with multiple interactions, and much more. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10-1000 events per second, depending on process studied. References: [1] T. Sj{\"{o}}strand, P. Ed{\'{e}}n, C. Friberg, L. L{\"{o}}nnblad, G. Miu, S. Mrenna, E. Norrbin, Comput. Phys.

abstract = {This Letter presents a measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section using 60 $\mu$b-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy s of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Inelastic interactions are selected using rings of plastic scintillators in the forward region (2.07<|$\eta$|<3.86) of the detector. A cross section of 68.1±1.4 mb is measured in the fiducial region $\xi$=MX2/s>10-6, where MX is the larger invariant mass of the two hadronic systems separated by the largest rapidity gap in the event. In this $\xi$ range the scintillators are highly efficient. For diffractive events this corresponds to cases where at least one proton dissociates to a system with MX>13 GeV. The measured cross section is compared with a range of theoretical predictions. When extrapolated to the full phase space, a cross section of 78.1±2.9 mb is measured, consistent with the inelastic cross section increasing with center-of-mass energy.},

abstract = {We present a new set of parton distributions, NNPDF3.1, which updates NNPDF3.0, the first global set of PDFs determined using a methodology validated by a closure test. The update is motivated by recent progress in methodology and available data, and involves both. On the methodological side, we now parametrize and determine the charm PDF alongside the light-quark and gluon ones, thereby increasing from seven to eight the number of independent PDFs. On the data side, we now include the D0 electron and muon W asymmetries from the final Tevatron dataset, the complete LHCb measurements of W and Z production in the forward region at 7 and 8 TeV, and new ATLAS and CMS measurements of inclusive jet and electroweak boson production. We also include for the first time top-quark pair differential distributions and the transverse momentum of the Z bosons from ATLAS and CMS. We investigate the impact of parametrizing charm and provide evidence that the accuracy and stability of the PDFs are thereby improved. We study the impact of the new data by producing a variety of determinations based on reduced datasets. We find that both improvements have a significant impact on the PDFs, with some substantial reductions in uncertainties, but with the new PDFs generally in agreement with the previous set at the one-sigma level. The most significant changes are seen in the light-quark flavor separation, and in increased precision in the determination of the gluon. We explore the implications of NNPDF3.1 for LHC phenomenology at Run II, compare with recent LHC measurements at 13 TeV, provide updated predictions for Higgs production cross-sections and discuss the strangeness and charm content of the proton in light of our improved dataset and methodology. The NNPDF3.1 PDFs are delivered for the first time both as Hessian sets, and as optimized Monte Carlo sets with a compressed number of replicas.},

The standard approximate intervals based on maximum likelihood theory, $\theta$̂ ± $\sigma$̂z($\alpha$), can be quite misleading. In practice, tricks based on transformations, bias corrections, and so forth, are often used to improve their accuracy. The bootstrap confidence intervals discussed in this article automatically incorporate such tricks without requiring the statistician to think them through for each new application, at the price of a considerable increase in computational effort. The new intervals incorporate an improvement over previously suggested methods, which results in second-order correctness in a wide variety of problems. In addition to parametric families, bootstrap intervals are also developed for nonparametric situations.},

We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV e + e − collider.

The theory of these methods is shown by analysing the global and local convergence properties of a basic algorithm, and we find that superlinear convergence requires less second derivative information than in the unconstrained case. Moreover, in order to avoid the difficulties of inconsistent linear approximations to constraints, careful consideration is given to the calculation of search directions by unconstrained minimization subproblems. The Maratos effect and relations to reduced gradient algorithms are studied briefly.},

abstract = {SHERPA is a general-purpose Monte Carlo event generator for the simulation of particle collisions in high-energy collider experiments. We summarise essential features and improvements of the SHERPA 2.2 release series, which is heavily used for event generation in the analysis and interpretation of LHC Run 1 and Run 2 data. We highlight a decade of developments towards ever higher precision in the simulation of particle-collision events.},

This version comes with a number of improvements including: an interface to the Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) format allowing the simulation of a wide range of new-physics models; developments of the Matchbox framework for next-to-leading order (NLO) simulations; better treatment of QCD radiation in heavy particle decays in new-physics models; a new tune of underlying event and colour connection parameters that allows a good simultaneous description of both Tevatron and LHC underlying event data and the effective cross-section parameter for double-parton scattering.},

@article{ATLAS2017densetracking,
abstract = {With the increase in energy of the Large Hadron Collider to a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV for Run 2, events with dense environments, such as in the cores of high-energy jets, became a focus for new physics searches as well as measurements of the Standard Model. These environments are characterized by charged-particle separations of the order of the tracking detectors sensor granularity. Basic track quantities are compared between 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS experiment and simulation of proton-proton collisions producing high-transverse-momentum jets at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The impact of charged-particle separations and multiplicities on the track reconstruction performance is discussed. The efficiency in the cores of jets with transverse momenta between 200 GeV and 1600 GeV is quantified using a novel, data-driven, method. The method uses the energy loss, dE/dx, to identify pixel clusters originating from two charged particles. Of the charged particles creating these clusters, the measured fraction that fail to be reconstructed is $0.061 \pm 0.006 \textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.014 \textrm{(syst.)}$ and $0.093 \pm 0.017 \textrm{(stat.)}\pm 0.021 \textrm{(syst.)}$ for jet transverse momenta of 200-400 GeV and 1400-1600 GeV, respectively.},

@article{ATLAS2020a,
abstract = {The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider reads out particle collision data from over 100 million electronic channels at a rate of approximately 100 kHz, with a recording rate for physics events of approximately 1 kHz. Before being certified for physics analysis at computer centres worldwide, the data must be scrutinised to ensure they are clean from any hardware or software related issues that may compromise their integrity. Prompt identification of these issues permits fast action to investigate, correct and potentially prevent future such problems that could render the data unusable. This is achieved through the monitoring of detector-level quantities and reconstructed collision event characteristics at key stages of the data processing chain. This paper presents the monitoring and assessment procedures in place at ATLAS during 2015-2018 data-taking. Through the continuous improvement of operational procedures, ATLAS achieved a high data quality efficiency, with 95.6\% of the recorded proton-proton collision data collected at s=13 TeV certified for physics analysis.},
