# PhD Thesis -- Electroweak Multiboson Interactions in Z&gamma;jj

Contained is the LaTeX source for my thesis, submitted for my PhD in particle physics.
The [pdf](https://github.com/Hazza4569/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf) is included with the source
for convenience.

The research contained accounts for four years of my life, from 2019 to 2023, and provides world-leading
results for two ultra-low-rate physics processes, as well as contributions to the betterment of the ATLAS
detector and experiment through work on the calorimeter trigger.

## Word count

To track progress throughout the writing process, I used a word-counting script to approximate the
size of my thesis over time:
