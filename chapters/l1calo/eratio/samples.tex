%% Monte Carlo samples %%

Simulations used for the performance studies presented here are from two Monte
Carlo samples: a Z$\to ee$ sample providing signal EM objects that the trigger
should be accepting, and a minimum bias QCD sample providing background objects,
typically low-energy jets, that the trigger should be rejecting. The signal
sample is generated by 
\powheg \cite{Frixione2007}
and \pythia \cite{Sjostrand2006, Sjostrand2008},
and the background sample is generated by \pythia.

After being processed by the typical ATLAS detector simulation (see Section
X), %TODO
additional simulations of the upgraded trigger are performed by the Phase-I
offline software in order to simulate the \ac{eFEX} response to each event.
