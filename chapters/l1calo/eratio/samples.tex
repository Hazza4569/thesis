%% Monte Carlo samples %%

Simulations used for the performance studies presented here are from two
\acf{MC} samples: a Z$\to ee$ sample providing signal \ac{EM} objects that the trigger
should be accepting, and a minimum bias \ac{QCD} sample providing background objects,
typically low-energy jets, that the trigger should be rejecting. The signal
sample is generated by 
\powheg \cite{powheg}
and \pythia \cite{pythia8dot1},
and the background sample is generated by \pythia.

Samples are processed by the typical ATLAS detector simulation (see Section
\ref{sec:theory-mc}) and are overlaid with pileup events. Samples with the
highest available pileup\footnote{at the time of analysing} (80 proton-proton
interaction per bunch crossing) were used as these studies are intended to
represent \ac{HL-LHC} conditions.  Additional simulations of the upgraded
trigger are performed on samples by the Phase-I offline software, in order to
simulate the \ac{eFEX} response to each event.
