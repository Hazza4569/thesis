%%% Performance benchmarks subsection %%%

These studies focus on performance of the \egamma trigger at hardware level. As
such, the goal is to ensure the signal efficiency (the fraction of signal events
selected by the trigger) is as high as possible. At the same time the amount of
background being rejected should be as high as possible; this corresponds to
maximising the background rejection, where
%
\begin{equation*}
  \text{background~rejection} ~~=~~
  \frac1{\text{fraction~of~background~events~selected}}.
\end{equation*}
%

Both signal efficiency and background rejection will be dependent on the
selections made by different algorithms. To compare algorithms, or different
variants of an algorithm, both of these quantities must be considered.  The
typical performance benchmark used in these studies will be the background
rejection at 95\% signal efficiency.
