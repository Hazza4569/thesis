%%% Performance benchmarks subsection %%%

These studies focus on performance of the \egamma trigger at hardware level. As
such, the goal is to maintain a signal efficiency, fraction of signal events
selected by the trigger, as high as possible. At the same time the amount of
background being rejected should be as high as possible; this responds to
maximising the background rejection, where
%
\begin{equation*}
  \text{background~rejection} ~~=~~
  \frac1{\text{fraction~of~background~events~selected}}.
\end{equation*}
%

Both signal efficiency and background rejection will be dependent on the
selections made by different algorithms. To compare algorithms, or different
variants of an algorithm, both of these quantities must be considered.  The
typical benchmark used in these studies will be the background rejection at 95\%
signal efficiency.
