%% Data subsection

Two runs were used to provide the data for this analysis: Run 423433, taken on
31 May 2022, and Run 427885, from 10 July 2022. These runs were taken in quite
different conditions, the first with lower intensity beams and no stable
beam conditions, and the second with high intensity stable beams. Notably, the
second of these runs had bunch trains with 25 $ns$ separation between bunches,
whereas the first had only isolated bunches.

Events are taken from the \verb|physics_Main| stream. This stream contains
1,636,636 events for Run 423433 and 107,016 events for Run 427885.
