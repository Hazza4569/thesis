%% TOB and RoI selection subsection

Phase-1 \acp{TOB} and Run-2 \acp{RoI} in events are compared to find instances
in the same event that have the same, or very similar, $\eta$-$\phi$
coordinates. 
A pair is formed by selecting, for each \ac{TOB}, the nearest \ac{RoI} that
has not already been matched to a \ac{TOB}.
A match is considered to be a pair of objects within $\pm$1 trigger
tower in both $\eta$ and $\phi$, i.e. a \ac{TOB} matches an \ac{RoI} if it falls
within the $3\times3$ area of trigger towers centred on the tower containing the
\ac{RoI}. Matched objects are considered to be the same physics object,
identified independently by both systems. 
%
Instances where there is a \ac{TOB} or \ac{RoI} with no analogue in the opposing
system are also tracked.

Only the barrel region was considered for this as a preliminary investigation,
since it has a simpler geometry and as such it is easier to isolate bugs. Also,
at the time of analysing, only half of the eFEX modules were installed so the
Phase-1 system had coverage for half of the $\phi$ range; only \acp{RoI} inside
of this coverage are accepted.
