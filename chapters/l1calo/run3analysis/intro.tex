At the start of Run 3, the Phase-I \ac{L1Calo} trigger was being used for the
first time, having just been installed in the \ac{ATLAS} detector. In these
early stages, the new Phase-I system was running in parallel to the Run-2
system, with the Run-2 system being used in the trigger menu until the
new system was fully commissioned.

One of the key goals in this time period was validating the Phase-I trigger
system, comparing it to the Run-2 system to identify any differences which may
have arisen from bugs or hardware issues. This section describes analysis of
some early Run-3 data contributing to this goal.
