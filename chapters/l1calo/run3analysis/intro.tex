%% What am I saying about this data analysis?
%% + I did some data analysis
%% + Give me PhD plz

%% + Code matches data from eFEX TOBs with those from CPM RoIs in the same events
%% + Outputs TOBs and RoIs to file to be read in and analysed

%% + AIM: to identify differences in EM trigger performance between Phase-1 and legacy systems

At the start of Run 3, the Phase-1 \ac{L1Calo} trigger was being used for the
first time, having just been installed in the \ac{ATLAS} detector. In these
early stages, the new Phase-1 system was running in parallel to the Run-2
system, but the Run-2 system was still being used in the trigger menu over the
new system.
%TODO make sure trigger menu is explained, particularly in this context.

One of the key goals of this time period was validating the Phase-1 trigger
system, comparing it to the Run-2 system to identify any differences which may
have arisen from bugs or hardware issues. This section describes analysis of
some early Run-3 data contributing to this goal.
