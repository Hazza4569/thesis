%%% INPUT DATA SUBSECTION %%%
The visualisation software takes as input the calorimeter energies visible to a
single \ac{eFEX} \ac{FPGA}. This covers a $6\times10$ area (in $\eta\times\phi$)
of trigger towers, with each tower being split into SuperCells across 5
calorimeter layers, as described in Section \ref{sec:trig-upgrade-p1}.
%TODO add reference to section describing eFEX SuperCells.
For each event, the input data provides one energy value per SuperCell, with
encoded energies.

From this input data, a $3\times3$ area of trigger towers, centred on an
$(\eta,\phi)$ coordinate provided by the user, is extracted and displayed
on-screen. This area covers all energy values used for \ac{eFEX} algorithms if
the seed of the \ac{TOB} is located in the central trigger tower.
