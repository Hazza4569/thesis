%% USAGE SECTION

The visualisation tool was used at several stages during commissioning of the
\ac{eFEX}. Primarily it was used to compare firmware algorithms to their
implementation in online software. Each time there was a difference found
between the two, the event could be checked with the visualiser to help
determine which of them was correct and to work out how the other might have
gone wrong.

Once there was sufficient confidence in the similarity between online simulation
and firmware implementations, the visualiser was again used to help in tests
comparing online and offline simulations. The same technique was applied here to
help ensure offline simulations were running with the same results as their
online equivalent, and to help find errors in cases where they were not.
