In order to aid in debugging minor differences between different implementations
of \ac{eFEX} algorithms, an algorithm visualisation program was created.
%
The program reads input data and performs aspects of \ac{eFEX} algorithms whilst
also providing a visual representation of what the algorithm is doing and where
the result comes from.

The visualiser is written in JavaScript, using Node.js \cite{nodejs} to
interface with some server-side C++ scripts, which are needed to access energy
decoders from trigger software, and Express.js \cite{expressjs} to handle the
web-based \ac{UI}.
