%%% MOTIVATION SUBSECTION %%%
During development of algorithms for the hardware trigger, each algorithm is
implemented multiple times. First, algorithms will be implemented in offline
software to be tested and tuned against simulations or existing data. Then, in
order to run on hardware, the algorithm needs to be ported to firmware. Often, to
provide closer cross-checks of the firmware algorithms, they are also simulated
in online software. Inevitably, due to software and firmware bugs, subtle
differences will exist between these algorithms; these differences need to be
understood and corrected to have a complete bug-free implementation.

The need to find these subtle differences between algorithms motivates the
visualisation software discussed here. Although at first it seems illogical to
add an additional, independent, implementation of the algorithm (since the issue
is in part due to having multiple different implementations), the added
visualisation aspect makes it easier to understand where a particular algorithm
implementation might have gone wrong in cases where there are discrepancies.
This has been demonstrated through the use of the visualisation software in
tests, discussed in Section \ref{sec:trig-vis-usage}.
