\section{Evolution of the Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger}
\label{sec:trig-upgrade}

The \acf{L1Calo} system, as used for Run 2 of the \ac{LHC} in the \ac{ATLAS}
detector, is described in Section \ref{sec:detector-atlas-tdaq-l1}.
This chapter focuses on work done towards upgrading this system for later
\ac{LHC} runs.
In the long shutdown between Run 2 and Run 3, significant improvements were made
to the system as part of the Phase-I upgrade.
The long shutdown following Run 3 will facilitate further changes with the
Phase-II upgrade, preparing \ac{L1Calo} for the \ac{HL-LHC} in Run 4.

%In this chapter, ...
%^ don't think this sort of thing belongs here. perhaps an intro to the chapter?
%Though not sure if I need one of those

Sections \ref{sec:trig-vis} and \ref{sec:trig-r3anal} discuss aspects of work on the
Phase-I upgrade and Section \ref{sec:trig-eratio} discusses work on the Phase-II
upgrade, all with a focus on triggers for \egamma signatures. Details of the
\ac{L1Calo} system as implemented/planned for Phase I and Phase II, with the
major changes in comparison to the Run-2 system and to each other, are given in
Sections \ref{sec:trig-upgrade-p1} and \ref{sec:trig-upgrade-p2} respectively.
