\section{Upgrades of the Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger}
\label{sec:trig-upgrade}

% Will give here an overview of the 2 relevant upgrades for L1Calo, focusing on
% how they change things relative to the Run-2 system.
% TODO where will I have a discussion of different runs and phases of LHC/ATLAS?
% > in detector chapter I suppose.

The \ac{L1Calo} system described in Section X % TODO reference to relevant part
                                              % of detector chapter
is what was in use in \ac{ATLAS} throughout Run 2 of the \ac{LHC}. In the long
shutdown between Run 2 and Run 3, significant improvements were made to the
system as part of the Phase-I upgrade. Once Run 3 is complete, there will be
another long shutdown in which further changes will be made in the Phase-II
upgrade to the \ac{L1Calo} system in preparation for Run 4, the \ac{HL-LHC}.

%In this chapter, ...
%^ don't think this sort of thing belongs here. perhaps an intro to the chapter?
%Though not sure if I need one of those

Sections \ref{sec:trig-vis} and \ref{sec:trig-r3anal} discuss work on the
Phase-I upgrade, and Section \ref{sec:trig-eratio} discusses work on the
Phase-II upgrade. Details of of the \ac{L1Calo} system as implemented/planned
for Phase I and Phase II, with the major changes in comparison to the Run-2
system and to each other, are given in Sections \ref{sec:trig-upgrade-p1} and
\ref{sec:trig-upgrade-p2} respectively.
