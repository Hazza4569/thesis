%%% Phase-I upgrade subsection %%%

The Phase-I upgrade has progressed alongside the work discussed in this chapter,
to the point where the system is fully implemented and in use in Run 3 at the
time of writing this thesis. The goal of the Phase-I upgrade to \ac{L1Calo} is
a redesign of the core components of the trigger in order to handle more data
and make more refined decisions while rejecting events.

%diagram, introduce it
The core components introduced in the Phase-I upgrade are the \ac{FEX} systems,
which replace the \ac{CP} and \ac{JEP} in the Run-2 system. The \ac{eFEX}
provides discrimination for \egamma objects and $\tau$ leptons, the \ac{jFEX}
focuses on jet and $\tau$ lepton identification, and the \ac{gFEX} triggers on
large-radius jets and global quantities such as missing energy.

% What's left to say?
% - Go into more detail in eFEX
%   - SuperCells and their size
%  (want a good resource to get this info going w/ some diagrams?)
