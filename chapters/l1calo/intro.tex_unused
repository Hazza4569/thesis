Throughout the course of the PhD, several contributions have been made to the
\ac{ATLAS} \ac{L1Calo} trigger. Initially, this task served as authorship
qualification, making a technical contribution to the experiment in order to be
considered a qualified author of the collaboration. Work done as part of the
qualification task is detailed in Section \ref{sec:trig-eratio}.

Once qualification was achieved it made more sense to direct technical work
towards more current aspects of \ac{L1Calo} development, alongside a \ac{LTA}
working at \ac{CERN} enabling direct collaboration with on-site experts and the
opportunity to assist with hands-on installation work. Sections
\ref{sec:trig-vis} and \ref{sec:trig-r3anal} detail the work done during this
time period.
