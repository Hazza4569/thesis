% ====== Template Fit Section ======

The signal strength, $\mu_\text{EW}$, is used to parameterise the fiducial
cross-section for the signal process, $\sigma^\text{EW}$, where
%
\begin{equation}
  \mu_\text{EW} = \sigma^\text{EW}_\text{meas} / \sigma^\text{EW}_\text{SM},
  \label{eqn:vbs-fit-mu}
\end{equation}
%
i.e. the ratio of the measured cross-section to the \ac{SM} expectation. This
signal strength is extracted from the data with a maximum likelihood fit,
performed on $m_{jj}$ distributions in the \ac{SR} and \ac{CR} simultaneously.
\ac{MC} distributions for backgrounds and signal are used as templates, with
normalisations for the signal and \ac{QCD} \Zy background allowed to float in
the fit.

Electron and muon channels are treated together, using the sum of events from
both for all aspects of the fit.  Likelihood functions are built for each bin of
the $m_{jj}$ distribution in both the \ac{SR} and \ac{CR} using a Poisson
distribution, and these are all combined to form a single extended likelihood

Systematic uncertainties are included in the fit as Gaussian nuisance
parameters. The effect of each uncertainty on the normalisation and shape of the
$m_{jj}$ distribution is considered individually and a pruning system, described
in Section \ref{sec:vbs-prune}, is used to reduce the number of nuisance
parameters needed.

The fit extracts the value of the signal strength for the signal process,
$\mu_\text{EW}$. From this a significance of the measurement, under the null
hypothesis of $\mu_\text{EW}=0$, can be extracted using the likelihood-ratio
test. If the significance is greater five standard deviations, \ac{EW} \Zy
production is considered to be observed. The value of the signal strength can
also be used to give a measurement of the fiducial cross-section of the process,
given the of the \ac{SM} expectation of this cross-section, calculated from the
nominal \ac{MC}:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \sigma^\text{EW}_\text{SM} = 4.73
  \pm 0.01 \, (\text{stat.})
  \pm 0.15 \, (\acs{PDF})
  ^{+0.23} _{-0.22} \, (\text{scale})
  ~\text{fb}.
\end{equation*}

%TODO define fiducial selection for each analysis?
