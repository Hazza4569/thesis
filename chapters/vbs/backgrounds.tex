The dominant background for this analysis, QCD \Zyjj production, suffers from
known mismodelling for high dijet masses, which is precisely corresponds to the
region of interest in this analysis. Rather than using the \ac{MC} template
directly for estimating this background, the normalisation is corrected by
comparing with data in a \ac{CR} enriched in this background.  The centrality
variable is used to separate the \ac{SR} ($\zeta(ll\gamma) < 0.4$) from this
\ac{QCD} \ac{CR} ($\zeta(ll\gamma) > 0.4$). The \ac{CR} is rich in the \ac{QCD}
background and has a very small fraction of signal events, as the \ac{EW}
production mechanism peaks at low values of centrality. Figure
\ref{fig:vbs-bkg-centrality} shows the centrality distribution for signal and
background events.

    Centrality distribution for data, signal, and background estimates pre-fit
    (before any data corrections to \acs{QCD} \Zyjj). The dashed line marks
    the separation between the \acs{SR} and \acs{QCD} \acs{CR}. The uncertainty
    band is the combination of uncertainties from background estimation,
    \acs{MC} statistics, and experimental systematics. Overflow events are
    included in the last bin. \cite{VBSZy-CONF}

The normalisation correction is calculated by fitting a normalisation factor for
the \ac{QCD} background in the \ac{SR} and \ac{CR} simultaneously, allowing the
overall normalisation to be adjusted according to data. The shape of the
background is taken from \ac{MC}, but data in the \ac{CR} is used to validate
this shape and constrain correlated uncertainties.

Estimation for the remaining backgrounds; Z+jets, \tty, and WZ$jj$; is detailed
in Section \ref{sec:methods-backgrounds}.

% Z+jets
%The second-largest background is from Z+jets events, and enters the final state
%when a jet is misidentified as a photon. This background includes Z+jets
%produced through both \ac{EW} and \ac{QCD} induced processes.  The rate of
%particles being misidentified is not well modelled in \ac{MC}, and so the shape
%and normalisation of this background must be corrected with a data-driven
%method.
%
%The normalisation for the Z+jets background is calculated with the
%two-dimensional sideband, or ABCD, method.
%If the region in which the background is being estimated is region A, three more
%regions are defined by inverting isolation and identification criteria on the
%reconstructed photon. Inverting the photon isolation gives region B, inverting
%identification gives region C, and inverting both criteria gives region D. These
%three control regions are used to infer the amount of Z+jets background in the
%region of interest with the relationship
%%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \newcommand\Zj{\text{Z+jets}}
%  N_A^\Zj = R\frac{N_B^\Zj \times N_C^\Zj}{N_D^\Zj},
%\end{equation*}
%%
%where $N_X^\text{Z+jets}$ is the number of Z+jets events in the given region
%calculated by subtracting background and signal leakage from the data events
%i.e.
%%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \newcommand\Zj{\text{Z+jets}}
%  N_X^\Zj = N_X^\text{data} - N_X^\text{bg} - c_X N_A^\text{sig,data},
%  ~~\text{for}~X=B,C,D.
%\end{equation*}
%%
%The correlation factor, $R$, is given by
%%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \newcommand\Zj{\text{Z+jets}}
%  R = \frac{ N_A^\Zj \times N_D^\Zj }{ N_B^\Zj \times N_C^\Zj },
%\end{equation*}
%%
%where in this case each $N_X^\text{Z+jets}$ is the event yield observed in
%Z+jets \ac{MC} in this region. Also defined are signal leakage parameters,
%$c_X$, as
%\begin{equation*}
%  \newcommand\tsig{\text{sig}}
%  c_X = \frac{N_X^\tsig}{N_A^\tsig},
%  ~~\text{for}~X=B,C,D,
%\end{equation*}
%calculated from \ac{QCD} and \ac{EW} \Zy \ac{MC}.
%
%The shape of the Z+jets background is taken directly from a data control region.
%The control region should be very pure in Z+jets events, but also sufficiently
%high statistics. The chosen region is the anti-tight region, with no requirement
%on track or calorimeter isolation. This is equivalent to regions C and D
%combined but without the track isolation requirement.
%
%% tty and WZ
%The background from \tty events is estimated from \ac{MC} and cross-checked in
%an $e\mu\gamma$ \ac{CR}, which validates the use of a $k$-factor of 1.44 to
%scale the \ac{MC} normalisation. WZ$jj$ events make a minor contribution to the
%background, this is estimated solely from \ac{MC}.
