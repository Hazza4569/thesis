% ====== Pruning systematic uncertainties section ======

There are 74 experimental systematic uncertainties considered for this analysis.
With each systematic requiring an up and down variations, 148 nuisance
parameters would be needed in the fit. To limit the number of nuisance
parameters, and thus stabilise the fit, a system is developed to rank the impact of
each systematic on both the shape and normalisation of the $m_{jj}$
distribution. Only systematic uncertainties deemed to be significant are fully
accounted for in the fit, and those with less impact are pruned.

The first test for a systematic uncertainty is how uniform its effect is across
the dijet mass spectrum -- this will indicate whether it will impact the shape
of the $m_{jj}$ distribution. If a systematic is determined to have a
significant impact on shape, by criteria discussed below, then it is included in
the fit with one nuisance parameter for each bin in $m_{jj}$, allowing it to
modify the shape in the fitting process.

Any uncertainty not found to impact the shape should be assessed for how
significant an impact it has on the overall normalisation of events. Systematic
uncertainties with a large enough effect on the event yield will contribute one
nuisance parameter to the fit, and have the ability to scale the overall
normalisation. Any uncertainties with a smaller effect will be pruned, i.e. all
pruned systematics will be added in quadrature as a single extra nuisance
parameter to scale the overall normalisation in the fit.

Information on how nuisance parameters for shape and normalisation uncertainties
are included in the likelihood fit is given in Section
\ref{sec:methods-stats-llh-nps}.

%% Calculating stat uncertainties
\subsection{Calculating statistical uncertainties}

In order to determine whether the effect of any systematic uncertainty, on shape
or overall yield, is significant, the statistical error on the value of
the systematic uncertainty must be ascertained. This statistical uncertainty
arises from the finite size of \ac{MC} samples used to evaluate systematic
uncertainties.

The value of a systematic uncertainty on an event yield is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_\text{Norm} = \frac{ N_\text{varied} - N_\text{nominal} } {
  N_\text{nominal} },
  \label{eqn:vbs-prune-sigmanorm}
\end{equation}
%
where $N_\text{nominal}$ is the number of events accepted for a nominal
\ac{MC} sample and $N_\text{varied}$ is the number of events after the
systematic variation has been applied. Each of $N_\text{varied}$ and
$N_\text{nominal}$ has a statistical uncertainty. However, due to the fact that
these variables are measuring the same set of events under different conditions,
the two yields are highly correlated. The correlation is not known a priori, and
so the uncertainty on $\sigma_\text{Norm}$ cannot be calculated through error
propagation.

The bootstrap method \cite{Efron1979,Efron1987} is instead used in order to
determine statistical uncertainties while preserving correlations. This method
relies on resampling the event set to create replica sets of events of the same
size, with some events duplicated and some omitted. Calculating
$\sigma_\text{Norm}$ in each replica set gives a distribution of results for
which the standard deviation represents the statistical uncertainty on
$\sigma_\text{Norm}$.


%% Shape significance
\subsection{Determining shape impact}

For a systematic uncertainty that has no impact on the $m_{jj}$ shape, it would be
expected that the resulting variation is uniform across the $m_{jj}$
distribution. This is tested by calculating the fractional difference in yield,
$\sigma_\text{Norm}$, and its associated statistical uncertainty in bins of
$m_{jj}$. A chi-squared test from fitting a zeroth order polynomial to these
values provides a test statistic which should be distributed as $\chi^2(3)$ (4
bins minus 1 parameter for 3 degrees of freedom) under the null hypothesis of no
shape impact. A significant shape uncertainty is therefore anything that
deviates from this null hypothesis by more than a certain threshold. An example
$m_{jj}$ distribution and fit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vbs-prune-mjjfit}, for
a systematic uncertainty with an obvious impact on the shape.

    this systematic does contribute an uncertainty on the $m_{jj}$ shape.

The threshold chosen is a $p$-value of 0.05, i.e. chi-squared values
sufficiently high that there is at most a 5\% chance that the deviation arose
from statistical fluctuation. Uncertainties with a $p$-value below this
threshold have the full shape treatment in the fit, with per-bin nuisance
parameters. Figure \ref{fig:vbs-prune-shapeuncerts} shows the results of the
chi-squared test for the largest experimental systematics in the \ac{SR}. For
the signal sample, 30 of the 74 experimental systematic uncertainties have
a significant impact on shape in the \ac{SR}, while for \ac{QCD} \Zy there
are 18 significant shape uncertainties.


\subsection{Determining overall yield impact}

Any systematic uncertainty determined to not impact the shape of the $m_{jj}$
distribution can of course still affect the overall yield of events, and
therefore require sufficient treatment in the fit. This could be done by
assigning a single nuisance parameter to every remaining uncertainty, as all
will have an effect on some scale. To further reduce the number of nuisance parameters
required however, the less significant uncertainties are pruned.

In this case significance is determined by whether or not a systematic
uncertainty is consistent with zero. Taking the value of the systematic, per
Equation \ref{eqn:vbs-prune-sigmanorm}, and its statistical uncertainty as the
standard deviation, if the value is within one standard deviation of zero it is
considered insignificant.

All systematic uncertainties not passing the shape significance test but not
consistent with zero have a dedicated nuisance parameter in the fit. All
remaining uncertainties are pruned.
The relative change in yield from each of the largest experimental systematic
uncertainties is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vbs-prune-scaleuncerts}.

Of the 44 uncertainties from the signal sample that do not have a significant
shape impact in the \ac{SR}, 11 are still found to impact the overall
normalisation; the remaining 33 uncertainties are combined into a single
normalisation uncertainty. For the \ac{QCD} \Zy background, 11 uncertainties
affect the normalisation and the remaining 45 are combined. Across both samples,
this represents a decrease of more than 50\% in the number of nuisance
parameters that must be considered, contributing to the stability of the fit.
