% ====== Particle-flow jet validation section ======

A jet, being the name for a hadronic shower observed in the detector rather than
an actual particle itself, can be defined in many different ways. The standard
within \ac{ATLAS} was to use `topo' jets, formed from topological clusters of
cells in the calorimeter \cite{Aad2017b}. More recently a move has been made to
using particle-flow, or `PFlow', jets. PFlow jets improve on the performance of
topo jets by using tracks found in the tracking detector near to deposits in the
calorimeter. This allows PFlow jets to benefit from advantages that the tracker
has over the calorimeter: superior spacial resolution and improved energy
resolution for low momentum particles \cite{Aaboud2017a}.

Whilst PFlow jets have been shown to improve on topo jets in general, they are
not universally better in any scenario, each has its advantages. The most
significant improvements for PFlow jets are in low $p_T$ regimes, and PFlow can
only function in the range of the tracker ($|\eta| < 2.5$). Jets in \ac{VBS}
events would not typically follow these criteria, they are expected to be very
energetic and in the high-$\eta$ forward regions of the detector. This study was
therefore performed to validate that the new PFlow jets were still a good choice
for this analysis in spite of this logical disconnect.

The procedure for comparing performance between these two jet collections is to
investigate the difference in event yield from applying jet-based selection
criteria with values calculated from each jet type. All non-jet selection
criteria discussed in Section \ref{sec:vbs-selection} are applied first, then
jet-based selection criteria are applied and the resulting yields compared. For
simplicity, this was investigated in the signal \ac{MC} sample for Z$\to ee$
(but not Z$\to\mu\mu$) events.

Looking at the overall yield of events after each selection criterion shows that
the two jet collections give very similar results, always equal to within 1\%.
Table \ref{tbl:vbs-pflow-cutflow} shows these yields for the signal \ac{MC}
sample.

Differences can be further scrutinised by looking at each individual event; most
events should result in the same decision, pass or fail, regardless of the jet
collection chosen. This checks that the similar yields aren't merely a
coincidence, when in fact many events pass only one selection. Figure
\ref{fig:vbs-pflow-pies} shows these per-event differences in decisions.

    Impact of four of the key jet cuts on the analysis yield when applied in
    both PFlow and topo. Events are divided into four categories based on
    whether or not they pass the PFlow cut and whether or not they pass the topo
    cut. Cuts are applied in the same order as presented in Table
    \ref{tbl:vbs-pflow-cutflow}. Only events that passed the previous cut in
    both PFlow and topo are included in the results, to decorrelate the effects
    of each individual cut.
  }
  \label{fig:vbs-pflow-pies}
\end{figure}

For the vast majority of events, the two jet collections make the same
selection, with less than 5\% of events showing differences. These differences
can be further scrutinised by investigating the distributions in the cut
variables for these cases; if an event passes $m_{jj} > 150$ GeV with topo jets,
but not with PFlow jets, the PFlow $m_{jj}$ value should at least be close to
150 GeV.

    $p_{T}^{j,2}$ ($p_{T}$ of second most energetic jet) $ > 50$ GeV (top right),

    $10^3$.

  \label{fig:vbs-pflow-boundary-plots}
\end{figure}

Investigating the case where events pass selection with PFlow jets but fail with
topo jets, results for the four key cut variables are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:vbs-pflow-boundary-plots}. The distributions are, largely, as expected,
with peaks showing most values are close to the cut boundaries. It is notable,
however, that for the two variables using multiple jets, $m_{jj}$ and
$|\Delta\eta_{jj}|$, there are some strong outliers.

Events falling very far from the cut boundary in PFlow when the topo variable
fails the cut seem to indicate a significant disagreement between kinematics in
PFlow and topo jets. It is possible however that these outliers happen when the
$p_T$ ordering of jets varies between the two collection. Dijet variables are
calculated using the two highest energy jets, so a small shift in $p_T$ between
the second and third jets could cause dijet variables to be calculated with
a different jet pair and therefore give very different results.

This hypothesis can be tested by looking at the separation between jets
used in each event for the two collections. The variable used to measure
this is
%
\begin{equation}
  \text{min}\,\Sigma(\Delta R) = \min_{k_i\in\{(1,2),(2,1)\}}\sum_{i = 1}^2
  \Delta R(j^\text{topo}_i, j^\text{PFlow}_{k_i}),
  \label{eqn:vbs-pflow-minsumdr}
\end{equation}
%
i.e. the sum of the two $\Delta R$ values between topo and PFlow jets, for
whichever pairing of the jets gives the lowest value of the sum.  $\Delta R$ is
the sum in quadrature of $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$.  Figure
\ref{fig:vbs-pflow-drcut} shows the distribution of this variable for events
passing $m_{jj}$ in only PFlow. There are clearly two populations, separated at
$\text{min}~\Sigma(\Delta R) \sim 0.5$. The lower population should contain
events where the PFlow and topo jets are representing the same physical objects.
Requiring $\text{min}\Sigma(\Delta R) < 0.5$ on top of the existing selection
gives the $m_{jj}$ distribution shown in Figure \ref{fig:vbs-pflow-drcut}, where
now all remaining events are tightly distributed around the cut boundary.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\resource{pflow_drcut.pdf}}

    \ref{eqn:vbs-pflow-minsumdr}, for events passing $m_{jj} > 150$ GeV in PFlow

    but requiring $\min\Sigma(\Delta R) < 0.5$ (right).

This study, although limited in scope, serves to demonstrate that the key jet
variables used in this analysis perform very similarly in topo jets and PFlow
jets. Further studies could shed light on how systematic uncertainties differ
between collections, and which choice would give the most precise result, but
this was considered sufficient to update to the latest \ac{ATLAS}
recommendations.
