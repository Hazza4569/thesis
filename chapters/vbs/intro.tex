Vector-boson scattering provides a unique experimental signature, producing
decay channels with excellent potential to probe rare \ac{SM} processes; the
high selection efficiency achievable by exploiting kinematics of the \ac{VBS}
tag jets allows measurements to be conducted at lower cross-sections.
%
The \Zyjj final state can be interpreted as \ac{VBS} \Zy production, with the Z
boson and photon resulting from a direct multiboson interaction. This provides a
robust framework for studying these rare \ac{SM} interactions, motivated
previously in Chapter X.%TODO, theory chapter -- change to reference Section?
