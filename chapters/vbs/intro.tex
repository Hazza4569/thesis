% ==== Introduction Section ====

Vector-boson scattering provides a unique experimental signature, producing
decay channels with excellent potential to probe rare \ac{SM} processes; the
high selection efficiency achievable by exploiting kinematics of the \ac{VBS}
tag jets allows measurements to be conducted at lower cross-sections.
%
The \Zyjj final state can be interpreted as \ac{VBS} \Zy production, with the Z
boson and photon resulting from a direct multiboson interaction. This provides a
robust framework for studying these rare \ac{SM} interactions, motivated
previously in Chapter X.%TODO, theory chapter -- change to reference Section?
% Feynman diagram time
Feynman diagrams for \ac{VBS} \Zy production are represented in Figure
\ref{fig:vbs-vbsfeynman}, showing that \ac{QGC} or \ac{TGC} vertices are the
only \ac{SM} contributions at tree-level.

% VBS kinematics
In the archetypal \ac{VBS} event, a quark from each of the two colliding protons
radiates a boson. The two bosons interact to produce the \ac{EW} component of
the final state and the quarks, deflected from their original trajectories after
boson emission, appear as jets in the detector. Since the initial quarks are
typically very high energy, the angle through which the quarks are deflected is
expected to be small. The final state jets, known as tag jets, would therefore
be in the very forward regions of the detector, at opposite ends to one another,
and also still carrying large amounts of energy. These kinematics are typically
characterised by a large invariant mass of the dijet system ($m_{jj}$) and a
large difference between the rapidities of the jets ($\Delta y(j,j)$).

% Other EWK production
\ac{VBS} \Zy production is one component of the more general \ac{EW} production
of \Zyjj. The \ac{VBS} production modes are not gauge-invariantly separable from
others, so a direct measurement of \ac{VBS} \Zy is not strictly possible.
Instead, \ac{EW} \Zyjj production is measured with a selection designed to
enhance the \ac{VBS} component, matching the kinematics of the jets with the
expected \ac{VBS} signature. Figure \ref{fig:vbs-nonvbsfeynman} gives Feynman
diagrams for some non-\ac{VBS} production modes that contribute to the \ac{EW}
production mechanism.

    vertex.

% Introduce QCD as main background
To measure this \ac{EW} \Zyjj production, background processes with the same
final state must be understood. The dominant background for this analysis comes
from \ac{QCD} \Zyjj production. Figure \ref{fig:vbs-qcdfeynman} gives example
Feynman diagrams for this QCD production, which differs from the \ac{EW} mode as
the strong force either provides the interaction between the two quarks or
otherwise generates the final state jets. 
These strong interactions mean that the jets created must have compatible
colours to facilitate further strong interactions: the jets are
colour-connected. Additional interactions between the colour-connected jets are
very probable and will affect the observed jet kinematics, allowing these events
to be distinguished from \ac{VBS} events.
