% ====== Event selection section ======

Selection is applied to simulation, using the samples detailed in Section
\ref{sec:methods-samples}, and data to reach the desired \ac{VBS}-enhanced phase
space. Cuts are first made to the \Zy system following the prescription given in
Section \ref{sec:methods-selection}.

Imposing \ac{VBS}-like kinematics on the jets further reduces the phase space.
Jets are required to have a transverse momenta of at least 50 GeV, and a
rapidity of less than 4.4 in magnitude. There must be at least two jets, and no
b-tagged jets in the event. The dijet system, formed from the two highest
momentum jets, should have a mass $m_{jj} > 150$ GeV and an inter-jet separation
of $|\Delta y_{jj}| > 1.0$. A veto on `gap jets', jets
(reconstructed with $p_T > 25$ GeV) found in the rapidity region between the two
VBS tag jets, is applied to exploit the difference between VBS jets and
colour-connected \ac{QCD} jets. A loose cut is placed on the centrality of the
$ll\gamma$ system relative to the jets, $\zeta(ll\gamma) < 5$, where centrality
is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \zeta(ll\gamma) = \left|
                      \frac { y_{ll\gamma} - (y_{j_1} + y_{j_2})/2}
                            { y_{j_1} - y_{j_2} }
                    \right|,
  \label{eqn:vbs-selection-centrality}
\end{equation}
%
where $y_{ll\gamma}$ is the rapidity of the $ll\gamma$ system and $y_{j_i}$ is
the rapidity of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} highest energy jet.

These cuts define the analysis region, and are summarised in Table
\ref{tab:vbs-selection}.  This is further split into the \ac{SR} and the
\ac{QCD} \ac{CR} with tighter requirements on the $ll\gamma$ centrality:
$\zeta(ll\gamma) < 0.4$ defines the \ac{SR} and $\zeta(ll\gamma) > 0.4$ gives
the \ac{CR} used for the \ac{QCD} \Zy background estimate.
