% ==================== INTRODUCTION ====================

This chapter presents methods required to perform the analyses presented in the
following chapters. Two analyses are discussed, both making use of the \Zyjj
final state: \acs{VBS} of a Z boson and a photon, and semileptonic triboson
production of a Z boson, photon, and an additional massive vector boson (\VZy).
The majority of the methods discussed here are relevant to both analyses, which
have many common features. 

The primary difference between the analyses is the jet phase space:
very high energy forward jets in the \ac{VBS} \Zy case, and more central jets
with a dijet mass peaking around the W/Z boson masses in the \VZy case.
How these differences are addressed as the analyses diverge is discussed in
Chapters \ref{sec:vbs} and \ref{sec:vzy}.

First the data and simulated samples used for the two analyses are discussed in
Sections \ref{sec:methods-data} and \ref{sec:methods-samples}. The specifics of
how detector signatures are reconstructed into physics objects are detailed in
Section \ref{sec:methods-reconstruction}, and the shared preliminary selection
for the analyses is detailed in Section \ref{sec:methods-selection}.  Section
\ref{sec:methods-bdt} gives some background on machine learning methods used for
the \VZy analysis. Each of the backgrounds, which are common to both analyses,
is introduced in Section \ref{sec:methods-backgrounds}. Finally, Section
\ref{sec:methods-systematics} covers systematic uncertainties which affect the
two measurements, and Section \ref{sec:methods-stats} discusses the statistical
tools used to make inferences from the data.
