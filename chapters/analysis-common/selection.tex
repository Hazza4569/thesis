% ========== Event selection section ==========
%TODO add more detail on trigger
%TODO back reference to reco when talking about ID/iso reqs

Events from data and simulation undergo a selection process to focus on a phase
space that matches the desired final state. Data events are required to pass a
trigger in order to be recorded, and therefore the same requirement is placed on
simulated events for parity. For both analyses, any events passing either the
single lepton or dilepton trigger thresholds are considered.

For an event to be selected, first the basic objects in the desired final state
need to be present. There must be at least one photon passing isolation and
identification requirements. There must be precisely two electrons or muons
present, of the same flavour to each other but opposite charge, with both
passing isolation and identification.
%TODO remove this? Not part of Zy selection being presented here,
%but certainly necessary for both analyses
At least two jets must have been
reconstructed in the event, as per Section \ref{sec:methods-reconstruction-jet}.

% TODO overlap removal!!

Further selection is applied to the lepton-photon system in order to identify
events with a real Z boson and a photon not produced from \ac{FSR}. This \Zy selection is
detailed in Table \ref{tab:anacom-zy-selection}, and acts as a pre-selection for
both analyses before additional jet selection is applied.

% Discuss FSR cut
The cut on the sum of the dilepton mass and the dilepton-photon mass, $m_{ll} +
m_{ll\gamma}$ is imposed to reject events with photons from \ac{FSR}.  In an
\ac{FSR} event, the photon is radiated from one of the final state leptons.
This means the two leptons and the photon all originate from the same Z boson,
and their invariant mass should be close to the mass of the Z boson. The
invariant mass of the dilepton system in this case would be less, and so the sum
of these masses should be less than twice the Z mass.  In a non-\ac{FSR} event,
the photon is radiated before or simultaneous to the Z boson production, giving
a dilepton mass close to the Z mass and a larger dilepton-photon invariant mass.
The sum of the masses in this instance is typically greater than twice the Z
mass.  Figure \ref{fig:anacom-fsr-plot} shows a two-dimensional distribution of
these two invariant masses and how this cut rejects the population of events
with \ac{FSR} photons.

% TODO add ISR vs FSR Feynman diagrams? Might not be needed.

    the \acs{FSR}-rejection cut, events below the dashed line are discarded.
  }
  \label{fig:anacom-fsr-plot}
\end{figure}

\ac{FSR} events are rejected as the photon emission from a final state lepton
excludes the possibility of the photon having been produced in a multiboson
interaction, which are the focus of these analyses.
