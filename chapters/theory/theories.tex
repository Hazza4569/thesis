\subsection{Quantum electrodynamics}

\acronymused{QED}
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) describes electromagnetic interactions
between charged particles.  As a gauge theory respecting local $U(1)$
transformations it introduces a single massless gauge boson, the photon. When
formulated as a \ac{QFT}, \ac{QED} must therefore describe fermions, photons,
and the interactions between them.  The \ac{QED} Lagrangian can be built from
three terms:
\newcommand\LQED{\ensuremath{\Lden_\text{QED}}\xspace}
\newcommand\LDirac{\ensuremath{\Lden_\text{Dirac}}\xspace}
\newcommand\LEM{\ensuremath{\Lden_\text{EM}}\xspace}
\newcommand\Lint{\ensuremath{\Lden_\text{int}}\xspace}
%
\begin{equation*}
  \LQED = \LDirac + \LEM + \Lint.
\end{equation*}
%

The \LDirac term describes the kinematics of a fermion under Dirac theory
\cite{Dirac1930}. This is given by
%
\begin{equation*}
  \LDirac = \overline{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m)\psi,
\end{equation*}
where $\psi$ is a Dirac spinor, a four-component fermion field representing
up-down and particle-antiparticle states for a fermion of mass $m$. The
$\gamma^\mu$ are a set of matrices accounting for fermion spin, these are
commonly absorbed into the covariant derivative using the Feynman slash
notation, $\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu \to \slashed{\partial}$.

Maxwell's equations provide the terms \LEM and \Lint, describing the kinematics
of the photon and their interaction with charged fermions:
%
\begin{align*}
  \LEM  &= -\frac14 F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} = -\frac14 (F_{\mu\nu})^2, \\
  \Lint &= -J^\mu A_\mu = -q\overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi A_\mu.
\end{align*}
%
Here $A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic vector potential; $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the
electromagnetic field tensor, given by
\begin{equation}
  F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu;
  \label{eqn:theory-theories-qed-fieldstrength}
\end{equation}
and $J^\mu = q\overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi$ is a conserved current, satisfying
$\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$, for a fermion of charge $q$.

Combining these, and simplifying by defining a gauge covariant derivative
\begin{equation}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu - iqA_\mu,
  \label{eqn:theory-theories-qed-covariant}
\end{equation}
gives the full \ac{QED} Lagrangian:
%
\begin{equation}
  \LQED = \overline{\psi}(i\slashed{D} - m)\psi
                   - \frac14 (F_{\mu\nu})^2.
  \label{eqn:theory-theories-qed-lagrangian}
\end{equation}

This result could instead be obtained by starting from the Dirac Lagrangian and
enforcing local gauge invariance through the covariant derivative transformation
in Equation \ref{eqn:theory-theories-qed-covariant} \cite[pp.482-6]{Peskin1995}.
The form of Equation \ref{eqn:theory-theories-qed-lagrangian} is recovered with
the inclusion of the \LEM term, which is the only locally gauge invariant
formulation of a kinetic term for the field $A_\mu$. Its invariance can be
demonstrated from the local gauge invariance of the commutator $[D_\mu,D_\nu]$,
given
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    [D_\mu,D_\nu] &= iq(\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu)\\
                  &= iqF_{\mu\nu}.
  \end{split}
  \label{eqn:theory-theories-qed-covariant-commutator}
\end{equation}
%
This technique for deriving field tensors from potentials will be relevant in
discussion of other theories.

\subsection{Yang-Mills theory}
\label{sec:theory-theories-ym}

The \ac{QED} theory corresponds to a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and
as such is Abelian. Constructing a non-Abelian gauge theory respecting $SU(n)$
symmetries is more complex, but generically solved by the Yang-Mills theory
\cite{Yang1954}.

For generators of the Lie algebra $T^a$ and structure constant $f^{abc}$,
a gauge covariant derivative can be defined by
\begin{equation*}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu - igT^a A^a_\mu,
\end{equation*}
where a vector field $A^a_\mu$ is required for each generator of the $SU(n)$
group, and $g$ is a coupling constant. Here the exponents $a,b,c$ index the
generators of the Lie algebra, whilst $\mu,\nu$ index space-time dimensions, as
per convention. 

This gauge covariant derivative is a generalisation of the Abelian form, given in
Equation \ref{eqn:theory-theories-qed-covariant}, and acts on an $n$-plet,
$\psi$, of spinors $\psi_i$, rather than on a single spinor as in the \ac{QED}
case. The generators of $SU(n)$ serve to transform $\psi_i$ into one-another
through abstract rotations.

In analogy to the Abelian case in Equation
\ref{eqn:theory-theories-qed-covariant-commutator}, the commutator is used to
define a set of field strength tensors: the commutator
\begin{equation*}
  [D_\mu, D_\nu] = -igF^a_{\mu\nu}T^a
\end{equation*}
holds for a field strength satisfying
\begin{equation*}
  F^a_{\mu\nu}T^a = \partial_\mu A^a_\nu T^a - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu T^a
                  - ig[A^a_\mu T^a, A^b_\nu T^b].
\end{equation*}
%
This shows explicitly that for an Abelian symmetry group, with $[T^a,T^b]=0$,
the form of Equation \ref{eqn:theory-theories-qed-fieldstrength} is recovered.
For non-Abelian gauge theories, however, the additional nonlinear term is
introduced, featuring a product of gauge field potentials.
This represents self-interaction of non-Abelian gauge fields.

Substituting in the general form for the commutator of $SU(n)$ generators given
in Equation \ref{eqn:theory-symmetry-gen-commutator}, the general form of a
field strength for such a non-Abelian gauge theory is given by
\begin{equation}
  F^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu
               + gf^{abc}A^b_\mu A^c_\nu.
  \label{eqn:theory-theories-ym-fieldstrength}
\end{equation}
%
This leads to the Yang-Mills Lagrangian \cite[pp.486-91]{Peskin1995}, the most
general renormalisable Lagrangian for a theory respecting $SU(n)$ symmetry
expressed in terms of these field strengths,
\begin{equation}
  \Lden_\text{YM} = \overline{\psi}(i\slashed{D} - m)\psi -\frac{1}{4} (F^a_{\mu\nu})^2.
  \label{eqn:theory-theories-ym-lagrangian}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Quantum chromodynamics}

The strong force, or \ac{QCD}, is modelled by a non-Abelian gauge theory. The
fundamental particles that \ac{QCD} acts on are quarks and thus
a \ac{QCD} charge, known as colour charge, is attached to quarks.
Colour charge is analogous to the electric charge in \ac{QED},
but to describe the observed dynamics of the strong force three different
types of charge are needed, termed red, green, and blue. These each have `anti'
varieties (anti-red, anti-green, anti-blue) when attached to antiquarks.

Transformation of a quark from one colour to another acts as a gauge symmetry in
the theory; if all red quarks became green, green became blue, and blue became
red the predictions of the theory would remain unchanged. This rotation of
colour charge is described perfectly by the $SU(3)$ symmetry.

\ac{QCD} can therefore be constructed as a Yang-Mills theory under $SU(3)$,
with the Lagrangian following that of Equation
\ref{eqn:theory-theories-ym-lagrangian}. Given that the $SU(3)$ group has 8
generators, the theory of \ac{QCD} relies on 8 gauge bosons to mediate
interactions. These bosons are called gluons, and the 8 varieties are
represented as different colour-anticolour combinations of the gluons.

%Asymptotic freedom
It can be shown that the coupling constant (appearing in Equation
\ref{eqn:theory-theories-ym-fieldstrength}) for \ac{QCD} is actually not a
constant, and is dependent on the energy scale of interactions \cite{PDG2022}.
For high energies (i.e. small distance scales) the coupling strength tends to
zero, leading to `asymptotic freedom'. Quarks can only exist as free particles
in the high energy limit, whereas at and below energies of $\sim1$ GeV the
coupling strengths are sufficiently high that quarks are exclusively confined in
colourless composite particles, hadrons.

\subsection{The electroweak theory}
\label{sec:theory-theories-ew}

The \ac{EW} theory describes the weak interaction, and also encapsulates \ac{QED}
as it is unifies the weak and \ac{EM} forces.  It combines the local $U(1)$
invariance of \ac{QED} with the symmetry of the weak interaction under local
$SU(2)$ transformations, and thus is described by $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry.
The gauge covariant derivative for the theory is given by
%
\begin{equation*}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu - igT^a W^a_\mu - \frac12 ig'B_\mu,
\end{equation*}
where $a$ indexes the 3 generators of the $SU(2)$ algebra, $T^a$, and their
corresponding gauge fields, $W^a_\mu$. The field $B_\mu$ is required for
invariance under $U(1)$ symmetry.

The corresponding field strengths are then
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  W^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu W_\nu - \partial_\nu W_\mu
               + g \varepsilon^{abc}W^b_\mu W^c_\nu \\
  B_{\mu\nu}   &= \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

To treat this as a conventional Yang-Mills theory would result in four massless
gauge bosons from the three $W^a_\mu$ fields and the $B_\mu$ field.
This does not match experimental observations however, as the weak bosons are
known to have non-zero masses \cite{UA2discoveryW,UA1discoveryZ}.

The missing ingredient is  spontaneous \ac{EW} symmetry breaking through the
Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism\cite{Englert1964,Higgs1964}. When the Higgs field
takes a non-zero vacuum expectation value, a rotated set of the potentials,
$W^a_\mu$ and $B_\mu$, can be constructed in the Lagrangian instead, resulting
in gauge fields:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    W_\mu^\pm &= \frac1{\sqrt2} (W_\mu^1 \mp iW_\mu^2), \\
    Z_\mu     &= \frac1{\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2}}( gW_\mu^3 - g' B_\mu ), \\
    A_\mu     &= \frac1{\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2}}( g'W_\mu^3 + g B_\mu ). \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
The $W^\pm_\mu$ and $Z_\mu$ fields have mass terms in the Lagrangian, with
masses parameterised by
\begin{equation*}
  m_W = \frac{gv}2, \,\,\, m_Z = \frac{\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2}v}2,
\end{equation*}
where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.

This converts the previous form of the theory with four massless bosons to a
description with three massive bosons, the two charged W bosons and the
neutral Z boson, and one massless boson, which is identified as the photon.

Due to the non-Abelian $SU(2)$ symmetry group used to build this theory, 
self-interaction terms appear in the Lagrangian, as explained in Section
\ref{sec:theory-theories-ym}. The resulting interactions are discussed in
Section \ref{sec:theory-sm}.

Another result of the Higgs mechanism is the introduction of a massive scalar
boson, the Higgs boson. A detailed description of the Higgs mechanism is beyond
the scope of this thesis, but Reference \cite{Peskin1995}
explains the form of equations given here as well as giving much
more detail on the topic\footnote{
  This gives a good mathematical overview of the theory, but was published
  before the mass of the Higgs boson was known. Reference \cite{Thomson2013}
  gives a more up-to-date description.
