% VZy introduction

% intro and motivation
Triboson production of a Z boson; a photon; and an additional, hadronically
decaying, vector boson is another production mechanism for the \Zyjj final
state. This additional boson, denoted as a `V' boson, can be a W or a Z boson.
Measuring this V\Zy triboson process thus constitutes an inclusive measurement
of both W\Zy and Z\Zy triboson production.

Figure \ref{fig:vzy-feynman} gives tree-level Feynman diagrams for W\Zy and Z\Zy
production. Notably, W\Zy production is sensitive to the same \ac{QGC} and
\ac{TGC} vertices as \ac{VBS} \Zy production. Z\Zy is more limited by the lack
of neutral \acp{QGC} and \acp{TGC} in the \ac{SM}, but is therefore more
sensitive to potential anomalous couplings.
The reliance on these rare multiboson interactions means that the triboson
process has a low cross-section, similar to that of \ac{VBS} \Zy. %cite? give a number?
Without the distinct \ac{VBS} jet signature to select on, measuring this low
cross-section process is challenging.

% kinematics and discrimination techniques
The two jets, here a product of a boson decay, have kinematic properties that
distinguish them from background events, notably: a dijet mass peaked around the
W/Z masses, small rapidity separation between the two jets,
and an angular distribution consistent with boson decay products.
%^TODO cite something on W/Z cos theta distributions, have a reference if
%needed.
Additionally, more subtle differences are also present in many other variables.
Selecting W/Z boson decays to leptons is relatively straightforward, but the
more limited jet resolution and more dominant jet background makes doing this in
the hadronic decay channel more difficult.
This analysis employs machine-learning techniques to interpret this complicated
phase space; pushing sensitivity beyond what is achievable with a traditional
cut-based analysis.

%backgrounds
Despite the differing jet phase space, the backgrounds for this analysis are the
same as for the \ac{VBS} \Zy analysis. \ac{QCD} \Zyjj production is the dominant
competing process; the key difference between this background and the signal
is the kinematics of the jets, as both have a real Z boson and photon produced.
%TODO give numbers on relative cross-sections.
%e.g.
The QCD \Zy background has a yield X times higher than the signal after applying
selection on the Z boson and photon.
%
This illustrates the need for effective jet selection to manage this background.

%Overall strategy/aim
The goal of this analysis is to measure the fiducial cross-section of this rare
process in order to compare it to the standard model expectation.
This measurement is extracted from a template fit to the output of the
machine-learning model. %TODO update after fit is done
If the observed significance is sufficient, this will provide evidence for or an
observation of this process. If the significance does not meet these thresholds,
the measurement will be used to place limits on the rate of this process. These
limits can be used to constrain theories that might enhance the cross-section of
this process.
