% ==== DISCRIMINATING AGAINST QCD Zy PRODUCTION SECTION ====

The biggest challenge in this analysis is managing the dominant background,
\ac{QCD} \Zyjj production. Like the signal process, this background has a real Z
boson and photon. The difference is the origin of the jets, here not from a
boson decay but more likely radiated from the initial or final state.
%
Identifying and exploiting the differences in jet kinematics between this
background and the signal is therefore key to maximising the sensitivity of the
measurement. This section is dedicated to discussing this problem; the word
`signal' is used here to refer to \ac{EW} V\Zy production and `background'
refers solely to \ac{QCD} \Zyjj production.

%TODO give Feynman diagrams? Or reference previous Feynmans

% Talk about kinematic differences
There are a small number of kinematic distributions which exhibit a large
difference between signal and background that could be exploited effectively by
a cut. The dijet mass, $m_{jj}$, is an obvious example as for the signal it
peaks around the W/Z boson mass but for the background resembles a continuum.

For many more variables however, the differences are more subtle. There may be
an obvious difference in shape between signal and background
but there is no obvious cut or set of cuts that would create a signal-rich
region. Figure \ref{fig:vzy-bdt-ewvqcd} shows some distributions with the
largest signal-background discrepancies.

Building a cut-based selection with sensitivity to the signal is difficult, more
advanced methods might push the background rejection further. This section
explores and compares two methods for defining a signal-sensitive phase space
for the analysis: a cut-based approach and a \ac{BDT}, a machine learning
classifier introduced in Section [BDT section in theory chapter]. %TODO

The dijet mass variable is excluded from being used for selection in either of
these methods. This allows it to be used to define \acp{CR} with a low signal
purity in order to validate background estimates with comparisons to data. For
more detail on the definition and use of these \acp{CR}, see Section X. %TODO

These initial investigations were performed before many details of the analysis
were established and so have a unique phase space, detailed below.

% Section giving samples and phase-space for this study
\subsection{Phase space for preliminary studies}

The studies presented in this section use events from the \ac{EW} \VZy sample
(as defined in Section \ref{sec:vzy-selection-vzy}) as the signal and from the
\ac{QCD} \Zy sample as the background. All events are subject to the
preselection in Table \ref{tab:vzy-bdt-preliminaryselection}.  These cuts select
\Zy events with an earlier version of the full \Zy selection presented in
Section \ref{sec:methods-selection}.  No cuts are placed on the jets at this
stage.  Isolation, identification, and overlap removal for all objects are the
same as discussed in Section \ref{sec:methods-selection}.

\subsection{Comparison metric}
\label{sec:vzy-bdt-significance}

A metric is needed in order to evaluate the performance of a given selection.
Since the desired selection will be one that grants the most sensitivity to the
\VZy signal, a significance of the signal considering a background-only
hypothesis is used. This will emulate the significance calculation used for the
final measurement, though much simplified as it deals with only a single
background and no systematic uncertainties. Whilst the significances given here
are not comparable to that from a full measurement, they are comparable with
each other and will indicate which selection generates more sensitivity to the
signal process.

\newcommand\nobsi{\ensuremath{n_\text{obs}^i}\xspace}
As the $m_{jj}$ distribution is not used for selection, it is used here to
calculate significance with a binned likelihood method. Consider $n_b^i$ as the
number of background events in bin $i$, and $n_s^i$ the number of signal events,
from the relevant \ac{MC} samples after selection.  The likelihood of observing
\nobsi events in bin $i$ is given by a Poisson distribution with a mean of
$n_b^i + \mu\cdot n_s^i$, where $\mu$ is a signal strength parameter with
$\mu=0$ for the background-only hypothesis or $\mu=1$ for alternate hypothesis
with signal included. The likelihood, $\mathcal{L}$, of observing the set of
$\{\nobsi\}$ in each bin is then the product of each of the per-bin likelihoods.

Constructing the likelihood ratio
\begin{equation*}
  \mathscr{\lambda} = \frac{ \mathcal{L}( \{\nobsi\} ; \mu=0 ) }
                           { \mathcal{L}( \{\nobsi\} ; \mu=1 ) },
\end{equation*}
enables a likelihood-ratio test, with the test statistic $-2\ln\lambda$
distributed as $\chi^2(1)$ \cite{Wilks1938}, to calculate the significance of
observing $\{\nobsi\}$.

To obtain integer values for \nobsi from the \ac{MC} prediction, as required by
the use of the Poisson distribution, random toy experiments are run. For each
experiment, \nobsi is picked at random from a Poisson distribution with mean
$n_b^i + n_s^i$. Running 1000 of these experiments, calculating the significance
for each, and taking the mean of the results gives an estimate for the
significance.

These significances are calculated for each selection tested, given as a number
of standard deviations.
%TODO somewhere in theory will have some discussion of significances and
%hypothesis testing. Might have to reduce or adjust this section once that is
%written.

\subsection{Selection variables}

Building a selection to reject the \ac{QCD} \Zy background relies on identifying
differences in jet kinematics, and therefore placing selection requirements on
jet-based kinematic variables. A number of variables are considered, with the
full list given in Table \ref{tab:vzy-bdt-variables}.

\subsection{Cut-based background rejection}
% See plots here, from old codebase
% /mnt/naf/code/VZy-prep/extract_VZy/build/signifscan_nomjj2_SR1.pdf

The task at hand is to find a set of cuts to make, on variables from Table
\ref{tab:vzy-bdt-variables}, in order to maximise sensitivity to the signal
process. Truly optimising this, finding the best value for each cut given the
values of every other cut, is a many-dimensional problem with no reasonable
solution. Instead an iterative approach is taken: find the best cut on each
variable individually, take the variable with the cut gives the best improvement
in sensitivity and add it to the selection, then re-test all other cuts on the
new subset of events.

Identifying the `best' cut to make at any stage is a little subjective. For
instance, when applying the first cut, the selection that would result in the best
significance for the signal sample is likely too aggressive to allow for
multiple effective cuts afterwards. The method used is to calculate background
rejection ($1/$fraction of background events passing a cut) as a function
of signal efficiency (fraction of signal events passing a cut) for each
variable. By eye, these distributions can then be scanned to identify a possible
cut which gives large background rejection but maintains a high signal
efficiency. This allows for multiple variables to be included in the selection
before the phase space becomes too constrained.

    using the same $p^T_{j,2}$ threshold (right).
  }
  \label{fig:vzy-bdt-rejection}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:vzy-bdt-rejection} shows the background rejection against signal
efficiency for $p^T_j{j,2}$, which is the variable chosen to apply a cut on
first. A cut of $p^T_{j,2} > 35$ GeV is chosen, with a signal efficiency of 74\%
and a background rejection factor of 2.6.

Continuing this process, the most performant selection found consisted of five
cuts, listed in Table \ref{tab:vzy-bdt-cutbased}. Using the method described in
Section \ref{sec:vzy-bdt-significance}, the significance calculated for events
passing this selection is 1.2 standard deviations.

% Section describing BDT optimisation
\subsection{\acs{BDT} for background rejection}

The cut-based selection provides a baseline performance against which to
evaluate a \ac{BDT}-based selection. The \ac{BDT} can take many variables as
input and determine how likely an event is to be signal or background based on
the value of those variables, having first learned how the variables are
distributed differently between signal and background events.

The first step is to train a \ac{BDT} to identify these differences between
signal and background. Once trained, the \ac{BDT} is tested on an independent
set of events to evaluate its performance and test for overtraining.
To accommodate this train-test cycle, the signal and background samples are each
split evenly into two, one half used for training and the other for testing.

%TODO remove this note:
[Overtraining will be discussed in theory section]
% Something to fill in the gap here?

Several aspects of the \ac{BDT} are tuned to improve performance: the input
variables used by the \ac{BDT}, preselection applied to events before training,
and hyper-parameters of the \ac{BDT} itself. These are discussed in the sections
below.

%What to write?
% Input variable optimisation
\subsubsection{Input variable selection}

The benefit of the \ac{BDT} is its ability to handle many input variables and
generate a phase space sensitive to the signal. However, giving too many
variables to the \ac{BDT} creates an overly complex model and allows for
overtraining. Many iterations of input variables were tested to find a set that
is sufficiently small to prevent overtraining but with enough variables to allow
the \ac{BDT} to maximise the sensitivity.

For each set of variables tested, a simple overtraining check is used. For a
cut on the \ac{BDT} output resulting in a background rejection factor of 10, the
corresponding signal efficiency is compared between the training sample and the
test sample. Overtraining would result in a higher signal efficiency in the
training sample than in the test sample. A requirement that the test sample
signal efficiency is within $10\%$ of the training sample is used to mitigate
overtraining in the \ac{BDT} model.

Sensitivity attained by a \ac{BDT} trained on a given variable set is evaluated
by calculating the significance through the method discussed in Section
\ref{sec:vzy-bdt-significance}. To do this, a cut must first be placed on the
\ac{BDT} output. The value chosen for this cut will affect the sensitivity, so
in each instance many cut values are tested and the highest significance is
taken to represent the sensitivity of the \ac{BDT}.

After using these tests to compare many combinations of variables, the most
performant set was chosen.  The final set of 16 input variables is shown in
Table \ref{tab:vzy-bdt-ranking} ranked by their `importance' as determined by
the \ac{BDT}. See section [BDT section in theory chapter] for details on how
variable importance is calculated.

  %TODO add this (more detail?) to theory section
%Variable importance is based on the number of times that variable
%is used to split nodes in the decision tree, the separation gain from each
%split, and the number of events in the split nodes \cite{TMVAguide}.

The logarithm of the centrality, $\zeta(ll\gamma)$, is taken rather than the
