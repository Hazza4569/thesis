% ========== BACKGROUND ESTIMATION SECTION ==========

This analysis considers the same background processes discussed in Section
\ref{sec:methods-backgrounds}: \ac{QCD} \Zy, Z+jets, \tty, and WZ$jj$. In
addition to these, \ac{EW} \Zyjj events not matching the signal definition given
in Section \ref{sec:vzy-selection-vzy} are also considered as a background.
Z+jets, \tty, and WZ$jj$ are all estimated following the procedure in Section
\ref{sec:methods-backgrounds}.
% TODO : Come back to this when I have time? (section with R,c_X numbers)
%Additional detail is given here on the calculations for the Z+jets fake photon
%background in the phase space of this analysis.
The \ac{QCD} \Zy and \ac{EW} \Zyjj backgrounds are taken directly from
their \ac{MC} estimates.

More complex treatment for the \ac{QCD} \Zy background was considered, as in the
\ac{VBS} \Zy analysis. However, the phase space of this analysis is not known to
be affected by the mismodelling for high dijet masses and Data-\ac{MC}
comparisons, made in the three analysis \acp{CR}, show a level of agreement
within uncertainties. It is therefore considered that additional normalisation
factors are not necessary, the estimate from \ac{MC} is sufficient.
