% ========== EXTENSIONS SECTION ==========

With additional time investment, several aspects of this analysis could be
improved. It is unlikely that this would result in a drastically more
significant result, as such it would make sense to implement these changes at
such a time when additional data are available.

The biggest addition would be a merged jet channel. This was not studied and so
the sensitivity is unknown but, as most of the hadronically decaying bosons are
not expected to have particularly high transverse momenta, it is likely a
relatively small enhancement to the existing sensitivity. Regardless, this
remains the most promising route to attaining a more significant result for this
process.

There are some issues with systematic uncertainties in the result presented. The
first aspect of this is that some of the theory uncertainties on the signal
process are missing, as detailed in Section \ref{sec:vzy-systematics}. There are
also a number of uncertainties which could be reduced, as explored in Section
\ref{sec:vzy-projection}. Generating additional \ac{MC} samples would be a
priority for addressing this: the low statistics available not only contribute
dominant systematic uncertainties to the result, but could also be biasing the
signal strength measurement (see Section \ref{sec:vzy-fit-mixed}). This can be
achieved either by creating larger samples, or by creating samples tuned for the
desired phase space.
