# Master thesis to-do list

Prioritising final days of work. Will edit all chapters summarily, and
add big tasks to this list, which can be prioritised.

## To do

 + detector:    edit
 + VZy:         write short lit review (just add to intro?)
 + VBS:         write short lit review
 + VBS:         define the fiducial region
 + theory:      cross section calc. section in theory (introduce LO/tree-level, NLO etc.)
 + VBS:         impact of gluon fraction reduction?
 + VBS:         more discussion of largest systematics in pruning section
 + VZy:         give more detail on what ranking plot means
 + VZy:         add numbers for fake photon background
 + VBS:         more plots in results?
 + theory:      citations for experimental success of SM
 + theory:      citation for non-quantisability of general relativity
 + theory:      Note on renormalisability of gauge theories
 + methods:     MC event weights and normalisation
[when dave gets draft back]
 + methods:     re-edit


## Done

 + Methods:     edit
 + VZy:         edit
 + VBS:         (re-)edit
 + trigger:     edit
 + trigger:     add summary of current L1Calo P1 system (demonstrate improvements)
 + theory:      edit
 + intro:       edit

## Chapters completely finished

 + TRIGGER


## VZy extensions section

 + Merged jet channel
 + Add remaining theory uncertainties
 + Increased MC stats
    + Possibly affects bias on mu value
 + As above, mention possible effects of this
 + Jet flavour systs reduction (2nd dominant syst)
